This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Create your local `.env` file (see `./.env.example`)
2. Start the mocked api:
```bash
yarn start:api
```

3. Start the app
```bash
yarn dev
```



Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Lighthouse

To check the overall performance/seo/accessibility of the app use [unlighthouse](https://github.com/harlan-zw/unlighthouse):

```bash
yarn unlighthouse --site http://localhost:3000
```
